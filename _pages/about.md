# Hi!ðŸ‘‹

### My name is James Zhao and I Build Stuff.

I am a passionate Software Engineer with experience in both Full-Stack Web
Development and Machine Learning. I completed my undergraduate in Computer
Science at the University of California, San Diego (Spring 2023) and I am
currently pursuing a Masters in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University,
starting Fall 2023. Check out some of my projects!
